CYOE---Zombies
==============

A Choose Your Own Ending Program. Make your own choices while you try to survive the zombie attack.

This is one of my first programs. It's a basic loop program. The code branches to different stories based on the user's choice of actions. At some point I'll go back and edit it a bit, but it was a fun way to get the hang of loops. 

It's written in C++. It should compile and run with any C++ compiler (please let me know if for some reason it won't for you).
